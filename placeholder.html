        <p>
          I am a Full Stack developer living in Chicago, Illinois. I am
          interested in designing quality code that can be upgraded and improved
          upon with little difficulty.

        <h2>About Jimmie</h2>
        <p>
          I have been coding since I was a preteen. When I was younger, I
          focused on simple games, but now I find myself hooked on web
          development. I enjoy working with my fellow developers, creating
          meaningful friendships while trying to solve complex problems. Aside
          from coding, I am an avid reader and a creative writer. My favorite
          genre include fantasy, mystery, and adventure.
