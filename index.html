        <p>
          I am a Full Stack developer living in Chicago, Illinois. I am
          interested in designing quality code that can be upgraded and improved
          upon with little difficulty.

        <h2>About Jimmie</h2>
        <p>
          I have been coding since I was a preteen. When I was younger, I
          focused on simple games, but now I find myself hooked on web
          development. I enjoy working with my fellow developers, creating
          meaningful friendships while trying to solve complex problems. Aside
          from coding, I am an avid reader and a creative writer. My favorite
          genre include fantasy, mystery, and adventure.

            <h3>Quiz Application</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Summary:</b> A mobile-first, responsive quiz application. Makes
              use of the trivia api found at https://opentdb.com/. The purpose
              of this project was to increase my proficiency in React and
              TypeScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Problems:</b> This was my first project using typescript and I
              jumped in blindly. The first issue that I had, was abusing the
              power of explicit typing. I was explicit typing every variable and
              creating interfaces for every object. This ruined one of the most
              valuable aspects of TypeScript: clean, readable code.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Solutions:</b> My program was so confusing that I had to
              restart the project from scratch. This time I made sure to use
              implicit types where the type was obvious. I also made sure to
              break my ui into more components to improve readability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Future Goals</b> Replace the arrow buttons with a drop down
              menu. Customize the CSS to be desktop friendly.
            </p>

            <h3>Zelda: Breath of the Wild Compendium</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Summary:</b> This is a mobile-first, responsive web application
              that will fetch data from gadhagod's Hyrule Compendium API. My
              approach to this application will be functionality first, visuals
              last. The stack being used is TypeScript, React, and SASS. This
              application also serves as practice with JavaScript testing. Jest
              is being used for component testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Problems:</b> One immediate problem with the project was
              setting up the testing environment. At the start of the project, I
              wasn't aware that react has a default test in the latest versions.
              The older tutorials that I were following had me install a
              seperate version of jest. This produced errors that left me
              stumped for a while. <br />
              Another thing I learned is that typescript packages are installed
              with slightly different syntax than regular javascript. I had to
              use `yarn add @types/react-router-dom` as opposed to 'yarn add
              react-router-dom'. I didn't carefully read the documentation. I
              spent hours trying to figure out why my was programming was
              breaking. <br />It turns out, I assumed that the API response
              would give me an array of objects. What it actually gave me was an
              object with a property that contained an array of objects inside
              of it.
            </p>
            <p><b>Future Goals</b> Add the ability to sort.</p>
